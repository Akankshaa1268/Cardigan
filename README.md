<b> About cardigan: </b>
<br>
Cardigan is an all-in-one platform that connects individuals with NGOs while offering unique benefits like CIBIL score improvements for working professionals and credit score boosts for university students through verified volunteering and donations. With a secure blockchain system for data transfer and an efficient e-KYC process, Cardigan ensures trust and transparency. The app features a Giving Closet for clothes and money donations, updates on upcoming events, and a dedicated grading scale to track contributions for score upgrades. Users can also register their own NGOs or start initiatives, making Cardigan a powerful tool for community impact.
